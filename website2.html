    So In this problem, we have to table in HTML, as we can see that table have multiple rows and a column for rows and column there are <tr> and <td> tags used. we will try to create the same table as problem requirement but I want to tell you one thing while creating a table color may be different so don't worry about color actually we have to focus on creating a table, Color you can change and practice after table created.
